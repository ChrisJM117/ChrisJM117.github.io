## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1 

    This lab was easily one of my favorites cause it was super easy to create a Hello world statement, and then we edited that. This lab was straightforward and set a standard for coding throughout the rest of the year that I’d love.


* Lab 6 , part 2

    This lab became one of my favorites because we first learned to make if statements. If statements were a little challenging for me at first, but I got the hang of them by the end of the lab. My favorite part in Lab six was part two, the blackjack was my absolute favorite, It was interesting to learn how to do all of it.

* Lab 2 

    This lab, also an early lab, is one of my favorites cause we used strings to create variables. It was a fairly simple but enjoyable lab to do. The program prompted the user to enter a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present-tense verb.
