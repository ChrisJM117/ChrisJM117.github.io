## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1 
This lab was easily one of my favorites cause it was super easy to create a Hello world statement, and then we edited that. This lab was straightforward and set a standard for coding throughout the rest of the year that I’d love.


Lab 6 
This lab became one of my favorites because we first learned to make if statements. If statements were a little challenging for me at first, but I got the hang of them by the end of the lab.

Lab 2 
This lab, also an early lab, is one of my favorites cause we used strings to create variables. It was a fairly simple but enjoyable lab to do. The program prompted the user to enter a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present-tense verb.
